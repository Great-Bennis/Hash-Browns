Ingredients :
All you’ll need is russet potatoes, olive oil (regular or light, don’t use extra virgin) or vegetable oil for frying, salt and pepper.
If you want to add more flavor you could also add additional seasoning. Good options include paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, dried herbs, or cajun seasoning.
Recipe:
1.Shred potatoes on the large holes of the box grater (it’s okay if they start to discolor a bit as you grate, rinsing them next will help).
2.Preheat a 12-inch cast iron pan over medium-high heat.
3.Transfer shredded potatoes to a fine mesh sieve or colander and rinse while tossing a couple of times. Drain.
4.Transfer half of the potatoes to several layers of cheesecloth and squeeze as much liquid out as possible (or alternately press with a potato ricer), spread onto a double layer of paper towels.
5.Repeat with second half of potatoes.
6.Spread more paper towels over potatoes and press dry. Season potatoes with salt and pepper.
7.Add oil to pan coating bottom evenly then add potatoes and spread even. Press down on potatoes with a spatula to flatten so bottom browns evenly.
8.Let cook undisturbed about 3 – 4 minutes until golden brown on bottom, then flip potatoes (in several portions) to opposite side.
9.Let brown on bottom about 3 – 4 minutes. Toss once more and let cook until tender, about 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately with ketchup if desired.
